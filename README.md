## What?

Simple sensor and display code for an [MQTT demo series on Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/2016/05/09/minimal-mqtt-building-a-broker/).

## Contents

`display` is an RGB LED that tells you the temperature, based on data from `sensor`.  The whole thing runs on NodeMCU, and the ROM version I used is here too.  

Read the articles, set up an MQTT server (or use http://test.mosquitto.org), and flash up two nodes.  You're on your way to independent home automation.
